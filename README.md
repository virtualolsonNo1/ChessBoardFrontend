TODO:
- make it so there's a loading bar or something while stockfish not done, as it can take a few seconds, so if move played before that, eval will be too late to be rendered...
    - or just make useState lol
- fix castling but as that's a problem... e1 g1 vs e1 h1 or some shit, not sure about long castling...
